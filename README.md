# Overtime Calculator

This is a simple Python script to calculate overtime based on sales performance and deadlines.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

The script takes three inputs from the user:

- `quotafulfilled`: The amount of scrap sold (as a float).
- `profitquota`: The expected profit quota (as a float).
- `days until deadline`: The number of days left until the deadline (as an integer).

It then calculates the overtime value


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python overtime_calculator.py
